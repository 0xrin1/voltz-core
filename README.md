# Voltz Core
Voltz is a noncustodial automated market maker for Interest Rate Swaps (IRS). Voltz uses a Concentrated Liquidity Virtual AMM (vAMM) for price discovery only, with the management of the underlying assets performed by the Margin Engine. The combined impact of these modules enables counterparties to create and trade fixed and variable rates through a mechanism that is up to 3,000x more capital efficient than alternative fixed rate models, whilst also providing Liquidity Providers and Traders with significant control and flexibility over their positions.
